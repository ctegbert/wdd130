        Hi there, my name is Colton Egbert. I’m a 25 year old entrepreneur and software engineering student. This site serves as a virtual resumé of my experiences and interests. I hope that it can be helpful for a visitor that might be determining my ability to work well in a specific environment or on a certain project.

Some general information about me is that I was born and raised in Nevada, USA and was homeschooled all through high school. I have always had an ambitious spirit and started many small businesses as a young boy and teenager. In adulthood I’ve started and currently run 2, 7 figure corporations that are described in more detail on the Business Ventures page of this website.

I also grew up with an interest in music and taught myself to play the piano and organ quite proficiently as well as some basic guitar and cello. I wrote several of my own songs, did contract work for a video game soundtrack, and put on a community musical. 

I’ve also always had an interest in things mechanical and construction related. This comes in part because of my experience working for my dad as a teenager. I worked at a geothermal power plant that used the water from the energy production as a secondary product in alfalfa fields. My work there varied from operating heavy equipment to rebuilding turbines, welding, fabricating, farm work and everything
